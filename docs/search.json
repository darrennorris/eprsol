    "text": "1.1 Running R code\nThe previous section showed you several examples of running R code. The code in the book looks like this:\n\n1 + 2\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nIf you run the same code in your local console, it will look like this:\n&gt; 1 + 2\n[1] 3\nThere are two main differences. In your console, you type after the &gt;, called the prompt; we don’t show the prompt in the book. In the book, the output is commented out with #&gt;; in your console, it appears directly after your code. These two differences mean that if you’re working with an electronic version of the book, you can easily copy code out of the book and paste it into the console.\nThroughout the book, we use a consistent set of conventions to refer to code:\n\nFunctions are displayed in a code font and followed by parentheses, like sum() or mean().\nOther R objects (such as data or function arguments) are in a code font, without parentheses, like flights or x.\nSometimes, to make it clear which package an object comes from, we’ll use the package name followed by two colons, like dplyr::mutate() or nycflights13::flights. This is also valid R code.\n\n\n\n\n\nKnuth, Donald E. 1984. “Literate Programming”. Comput. J. 27 (2): 97–111. https://doi.org/10.1093/comjnl/27.2.97."
